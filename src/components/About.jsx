      Hello! I'm Danny Torres, a dedicated web developer specializing in
      crafting intuitive and dynamic digital experiences. With a strong
      foundation in front-end development and UI/UX design, I excel at
      transforming complex challenges into elegant solutions. Outside of my
      professional pursuits, I enjoy playing video games, engaging in activities
      with family and friends, and immersing myself in horror movies and
      podcasts. I am eager to collaborate on innovative projects and drive
      impactful results.
